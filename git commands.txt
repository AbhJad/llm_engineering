First, let's check which remote repository you're connected to:

git remote -v

Run this command and let me know what URL it shows. This will tell us if you're still connected to the original repository you cloned or your own repository.
Output is -

C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\learning_2025\llm_engineering\llm_engineering>git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering.git (push)

If you want to switch to your own repository:

# Remove the current remote
git remote remove origin

# Add your new repository as remote (replace with your GitHub repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git




Then you can add and push your changes:

# Add your modified notebooks
git add week2/day1.ipynb week2/day2.ipynb week2/day3.ipynb

# Add your text file
git add "Commands to Update the Jupyter notebook.txt"

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Updated week 2 notebooks with my changes"

# Push to your repository
git push -u origin main
